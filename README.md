#Getting started with voevent-parse

This tutorial should get you up and running with 
[voevent-parse](http://voevent-parse.readthedocs.org/), 
so that you can work effectively with the 
[VOEvent](http://wiki.ivoa.net/twiki/bin/view/IVOA/IvoaVOEvent#VOEvent) 
data format. 
It also covers some of the basics on 
[XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xml) and 
[lxml.objectify](http://lxml.de/objectify.html).

This tutorial is intended to accompany the 
[Notes on VOEvent](http://voevent.readthedocs.org). 
If you're new to VOEvents, I suggest you read those pages first. 
Both this tutorial, and the notes, were originally written to support the 
hands-on session at the 
[Hotwired Universe IV](http://lcogt.net/hotwired-iv-welcome/) 
conference, but should be accessible to anyone familiar with Python.

##Requirements
* [voevent-parse](http://voevent-parse.readthedocs.org/en/latest/intro.html#installation)
* [IPython](http://ipython.org/install.html) 
  (IPython [notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) strongly recommended, 
  but not essential.)

##Running the code
Run IPython Notebook from this directory and load up the notebooks. 
Or, if you prefer a regular (I)Python terminal, you can read through the 
``.py`` versions and copy-paste the code snippets as you go along.

##Ready-made versions
Can't be bothered to download this repo? Just want a quick reference? 
Here's some I made earlier:
* [01-parsing.ipynb (preview on nbviewer.ipython.org)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/timstaley/aea3e45f99a9d27a1856)
* [02-authoring.ipynb (preview on nbviewer.ipython.org)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/timstaley/d737a6a7d706709bae6e)
